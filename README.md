# RaysMovieClub

This GitHub repository is designed to store my Advanced Web assignment, a website hosted on Google Firebase containing React.js and its derivatives as part of my Diploma in General I.T at TAFE NSW

This website uses React.js, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, React-DOM, React-Router-DOM and PHP and uses databases as part of the website. 

~~This site is now complete and has been archived, this will no longer be maintained.~~ This repository is now being migrated to Supabase as an alternative to Google Firebase due to Google Firebase falsely flagging the Firebase Project as "phishing" and refusing to budge on removing the restriction. Progress can be found within the cloned version where changes will be made: https://github.com/reiyua/RaysMovieClubSupabase

There will also be an attempt at migrating the website from "BrowserRouter" to "HashRouter" due to compatibility issues with web hosting services other than Google Firebase not supporting the routing BrowserRouter uses.

There is no search component even though the website documentation specifies it as a requirement as it is incompatible with the website setup.

This website can be viewed through these services:
