# RaysMovieClub

This GitHub repository is designed to store my Advanced Web assignment, a website hosted on Google Firebase containing React.js and its derivatives as part of my Diploma in General I.T at TAFE NSW

This website uses React.js, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, React-DOM, React-Router-DOM and PHP and uses databases as part of the website. 

This site is now complete and has been archived, this will no longer be maintained.

There is no search component even though the website documentation specifies it as a requirement as it is incompatible with the website setup.

This website can be viewed through these services:
