This GitHub repository is designed to store my Advanced Web assignment for TAFE NSW, a website hosted on Google Firebase containing React.js and its derivatives for an upcoming assessment at TAFE NSW as part of my Diploma in General I.T.

This website uses React.js, Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, React-DOM, React-Router-DOM and PHP and uses databases as part of the website.
